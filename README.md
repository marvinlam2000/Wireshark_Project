# Wireshark Project

## Objective
This project is to demonstrate how you can use Wireshark to sniff credentials over Telnet. It's just a proof of concept that Telnet is not secure. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis. (Splunk)
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios. (Sysmon)
