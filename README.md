## Steps
Step 1. Download Windows ISO file and Virtual Box. Virtual Box is a platform to host virtual machines. This allows the user to test tools without affecting the users personal network or computer.

Step 3. Capture File Properties allows the user to understand what the first and last packet time were as well as the duration of the packet. This allows the user to confirm that the packet capture at the specific time is correct with what the employer is asking for.

Step 4. Understand the protocol hierarchy tool in wireshark. You can use apply as filter or prepare as filter to filter certain protocols in the packet list pane.

Step 5. Understand the conversation tool in wireshark. This shows the conversation between one host to another. You can also sort by byte to show the highest communicator. This can show a quick Win to show a high outbound.
